    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>My passion is being able to transform my ideas into reality and since I really enojoy working on my computer,
        I think the best way to follow my passion is through coding. With this, I have 2 goals for my future. The first
        one is to be able to launch my own product fully developed by me and that this one, somehow contributes in a positve way
        to society. The second one, is to be in a position where I'm able to give conferences or teach someone else what I've
        learned through the years.</p>
